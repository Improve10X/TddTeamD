//Find the repeating and missing numbers
//        Problem Statement: You are given a read-only array of N integers with values also in the range [1, N] both inclusive. Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers A and B where A repeats twice and B is missing.
//        Example 1:
//        Input Format:  array[] = {3,1,2,5,3}
//        Result: {3,4)
//        Explanation: A = 3 , B = 4
//        Since 3 is appearing twice and 4 is missing
//        Example 2:
//        Input Format: array[] = {3,1,2,5,4,6,7,5}
//        Result: {5,8)
//        Explanation: A = 5 , B = 8
//        Since 5 is appearing twice and 8 is missing
